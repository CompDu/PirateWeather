<ins>Weather App</ins>

Hi. This is a .NET Maui App for Windows to show off my front end skills with XAML.
The app also uses httpclient to access a json resource hosted here on Github.I am a full stack developer
.NET developer proficient in Maui.

The app uses community toolkit MVVM for 'seperation of concerns.'Keeping interface code seperate
from backend code.

All the images I made myself. They are SVG images made using open source vector graphics package
'Inkscape.'

Download the program and try it for yourself.
